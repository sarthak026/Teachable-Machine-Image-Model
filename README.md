# Teachable Machine Image Model

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a Teachable Machine Image Model, allowing users to create custom image classification models without extensive machine learning expertise. The model is trained using Google's Teachable Machine platform, and this repository provides the necessary resources to use and deploy the model in your projects.

## Features

- Easy-to-use image classification model.
- Trained using Teachable Machine for simplicity.
- Integration with popular programming languages or frameworks.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Teachable Machine Image Model:

1. **Training:** Visit [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and train your custom image classification model.

2. **Export Model:** Export the model from Teachable Machine and download the necessary files.

3. **Integration:** Integrate the exported model into your project using the provided resources in this repository.

## Usage

Include instructions and code snippets on how to use the model in your projects. For example:

```python
# Sample Python code to use the Teachable Machine Image Model

# Import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

# Load the model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path/to/your/exported/model')

# Load and preprocess an image for prediction
image_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
img = Image.open(image_path)
img = img.resize((224, 224))  # Adjust according to your model requirements
img_array = np.array(img)
img_array = img_array / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)  # Add batch dimension

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(img_array)

# Display or use predictions as needed
print(predictions)
